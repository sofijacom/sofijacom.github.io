_This page will tell you a little about Kennel Linux._


**Kennel Linux** â€” _This Linux distribution family, which are discussed on the [Puppy Linux Discussion Forum](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=228).
They are usually built using the_ **FIRSTRIB** _assembly system - a collection of shell scripts that creates a root file system for downloading with a certain bootloader_ (for example, GRUB).
_Kennel Linux contains a desktop environment, utility and an application of a developer that implements a script._ 


_There are many KL distros, each with their own unique features:_
